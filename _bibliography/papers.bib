	abstract = {Increasing global populations, changing water consumption patterns, and climate change are continuously putting a strain on available water resources. Identifying these changes in consumption patterns and future demand requirements through water demand forecasting plays a key role in the allocation, planning, and management of urban water resources and infrastructure. In the last decades, advances in statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques have shown promising results in predicting future water demands. This study aims to forecast hourly water demand, while factoring the effects of other exogenous features on consumption patterns using machine learning techniques for Telford Borough, a predominantly residential town in Pennsylvania, {US}. In this study, the predictive abilities of the support vector machine and the random forest regression models have been compared in forecasting water demand using past demand, and temporal and climatic features. The results demonstrated the practicability of applying machine learning solutions to water management with random forest being the best model, and temporal features being the most important in the exploratory variables. The authors conclude that these predictive models can be used for near real-time forecasting to guide the allocation and planning decisions of water resources.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a probabilistic forecasting method that predicts the future water consumption patterns, taking into account the inherent uncertainty in the system. The proposed method leverages statistical techniques to estimate the probability distribution of future water demand scenarios. The findings of this study will provide decision-makers with a range of possible alternatives that facilitate better planning and management of water resources. We developed a conformal prediction-based hybrid demand forecast model, which combines convolutional neural network ({CNN}) and bidirectional long short-term memory ({BiLSTM}) while comparing it with other machine learning models for probabilistic hourly water demand forecasting. Additionally, we address crucial considerations when implementing a probabilistic forecasting system, including selecting appropriate data and choosing model parameters. The performance of the proposed model is validated for probabilistic water demand forecasting in real-world settings. Results indicate noteworthy improvement in deterministic and probabilistic predictions by 10 \% and 26.7 \%, respectively. The findings underscore the potential benefits of this approach for improved decision-making and resource management. The results also demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model outperforms the compared machine learning models with better prediction performance and increased robustness for handling prediction uncertainties.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneity in the composition of municipal solid wastes ({MSW}) poses significant challenges in the production of biofuel and bioproducts. This research aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of waste analysis and characterization by introducing a fast characterization approach for {MSW}-derived refuse-derived fuels ({RDF}) by combining Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy ({LIBS}) with advanced machine learning ({ML}) techniques. The approach combines data pre-processing of {LIBS} spectra of {RDF}, and the development of {ML} models trained on domain and theory-based spectral features for predicting process parameters. These models are adept at predicting key process parameters like High Heating Value ({HHV}), carbon content, and volatile matter. This approach can achieve an average {RRMSE} of 2.13\% and R2 of 0.98 or higher for all considered parameters on testing data. This work demonstrates significant potential for improving waste sorting, processing efficiency, and environmental compliance over traditional labor- and time-intensive laboratory waste analysis and characterization.},

	abstract = {The impacts of climate change and the rapid depletion of freshwater resources underscore the urgent need for the exploitation of alternative water and energy resources to ensure the sustainable operation and management of the critical infrastructure associated with them. This paper proposes a mixed integer nonlinear programming economic dispatch model for the joint operation and management of integrated water-microgrid systems, while accounting for maintenance, reliability and environmental constraints within a unified framework. This study further tackles the associated computational complexity that might arise from solving such optimization problems, particularly for large systems, by developing a multichannel convolutional neural network model for realtime economic dispatch solutions under different operational conditions. The case studies analyzed in this work demonstrate that, under specific conditions, investments in maintaining battery energy storage system charge availability at the end of each day can lead to substantial operational and emissions cost savings, reaching up to \$8.4/day for the system under consideration. The developed data-driven approach also highlights the role of historical dispatch information on providing contextual insight offering more-informed future scheduling decisions, and with up to 94\% in performance improvements from baseline models.},

	abstract = {The strong interdependence between water and energy systems is primarily accounted for in the utilization of dispatched energy for the operation of pumps. The optimal utilization of water resources and the scheduling of pumps could provide substantial energy and financial cost savings of up to 23\%. However, the optimal scheduling for water distribution systems remains a challenging nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Existing approaches often rely on heuristics, which lack guarantees of global optimality, or adopt linear approximations that introduce numerous auxiliary variables and significantly increase computational burden. To address this challenge, we propose a novel linearization framework for the original {MINLP} problem that directly embeds machine-learning models trained to learn system constraints into the optimization formulation. We leverage the ability of machine learning models to learn complex nonlinear relationships between variables and their representability in mixed-integer optimization, including linear regression and multilayer perceptron neural networks, to linearize dynamic headloss and pump head curve relationships. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach using two small water distribution networks connected with a microgrid. We show that the presented approach offers competitive computational efficiency and improved solution quality compared to existing methods.},
